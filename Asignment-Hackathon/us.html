                        <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                        We are the ones who were once lost, like you. Django is
                        slowly changing the world. Through thoughts on topics
                        that range from polination and general bee-life (from
                        the perspective of an intruder larva), to tea-time in
                        'ancient alien' Rome, he has created a larger set of
                        word documents than any person as far as we know of so
                        far. <br />
                        The stories, the guides, the ponderings, the deep
                        analysis of his own farts (pungent and fear inducing),
                        now ask us again who we are!
                        <br />
                        We are his children.

                        He is loving and sensitive, but fair and stern like Bear
                        Grills. <br />
                        After a high-flying career as a door-to-door salesman he
                        finally heard a primordial call from a place far beyond
                        himself. It beckoned him with an intensity that he has -
                        to this day - only felt while standing in front of a
                        Berlin kebab-shop.
                        <br />
                        He started traveling the world from east to west, north
                        to south, South-America, Asia, Africa and Europe where
                        he finally crossed the Dutch border from Switzerland.<br />
                        There he meditated under a mountain the dutch called the
                        'Boterberg' (though nowadays nobody speaks of it
                        anymore, in the early nineties it was a formidable
                        size).<br />
                        <br />
                        After three weeks of walking on sandels and pondering
                        the universe and the public transport system he came to
                        the startling conclusion that the universe was in him
                        and therefore...
